Major Functionality and Interface Changes

- :ref:`release-v16-0-new-geom`
- :ref:`release-v16-0-decam-ingest`
- :ref:`release-v16-0-py3`

.. _release-v16-0-new-geom:

Reworked “geom” package, replacing much of “afw.geom”
-----------------------------------------------------

The ``Angle``, ``Point``, ``Extent``, ``SpherePoint``, ``Box``, ``LinearTransform`` and ``AffineTransform`` primitivies have been moved from afw.geom to geom.
Aliases for compatibility purposes remain within afw for this release, but new code should use the geom package.
For further details, refer to `this community.lsst.org post`__.

.. _release-v16-0-decam-ingest:

DECam ingest now defaults to raw image
--------------------------------------

``ingestImagesDecam.py`` (encapsulating ``DecamIngestTask``) now ingests raw images by default instead of “instcals”.
This change means that ``DecamIngestTask`` behaves more like ``IngestTask`` and other ingestion tasks.
For further details, refer to `this community.lsst.org post`__.

.. _release-v16-0-py3:

Python 2 is no longer supported
-------------------------------

This release is no longer tested on or expected to work with Python 2.
For further details, refer to `this community.lsst.org post`__.

.. _release-v16-0-starselector:

Improvements to the ``StarSelector`` interface
----------------------------------------------

The call signatures for source and star selectors have been modernized and unified as described on :jira:`RFC-198`.
Some legacy code has not yet adopted the new interface.

.. _release-v16-0-selectimages:

Automatically select the :math:`N` images with the best seeing when building templates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``MaxPsfWcsSelectImagesTask`` can now automatically determine the thresholds needed to select images with an appropriate PSF when building templates, rather than having them specified by the user.
For details, refer to :jira:`DM-11953`.
